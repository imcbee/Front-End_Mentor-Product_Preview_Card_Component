## Overview

### Introduction

This is my first practice on building a webpage with Front-End Mentor.  This project was to hone in my skills on HTML, CSS and JS.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- a little but of JS

### What I learned

What I learned was putting together what HTML and CSS understanding that I know from the time I started and completed this project.  I would like to get better at HTML, CSS and JS and I will continue with more projects from Front-End Mentor.
